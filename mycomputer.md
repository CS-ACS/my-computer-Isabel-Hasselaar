## Commentary
* I first got this computer for christmas 2018 in my 6th grade year. I have used this computer since and it has worked very well for me. I like the design of this MacBook and the way it operates.
* Things that cause my computer to slow down are opening too many tabs at a time. This can use up a lot of memory and affect the CPU. Additionally, keeping my computer open for too long also slows it down.
